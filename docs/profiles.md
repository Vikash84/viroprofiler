# Selecting between profiles

## What are profiles?

Note that some form of configuration will be needed so that Nextflow knows how to fetch the required software. This is usually done in the form of a config profile (`YOURPROFILE` in the example command above). You can chain multiple config profiles in a comma-separated string. They are a set of "sensible defaults" for the resource requirements of each of the steps in the workflow, that can be enabled with the command line flag `-profile`. You can learn more about nextflow profiles at:

+ <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#config-profiles>

## Available profiles

The pipeline have "standard profiles" set to run the workflows with either **docker** or **singularity** using the [local executor](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/executor.html), which is nextflow's default executor and basically runs the pipeline processes in the computer where Nextflow is launched.

If you need to run the pipeline using another executor such as sge, lsf, slurm, etc. you can take a look at [nextflow's manual page](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/executor.html) to proper configure one in a new custom profile and take advantage that nextflow allows multiple profiles to be used at once, e.g. `-profile docker,slurm`.

!!! note

    If `-profile` is not specified, the pipeline will run locally and expect all software to be installed and available on the `PATH`. **This is not recommended** and will most likely fail.

### Note on sigularity

If you are using `singularity` and are persistently observing issues downloading Singularity images directly due to timeout or network issues, try downloading it first. Setting the [`NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` or `singularity.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/singularity.html?#singularity-docker-hub) Nextflow options enables you to store and re-use the images from a central location for future pipeline runs.

!!! tip ""

    This is exemplified in the [installation page](installation.md#downloading-docker-images)

```bash
# run
nextflow run deng-lab/viroprofiler -profile singularity [OPTIONS]
```

Several generic profiles are bundled with the pipeline which instruct the pipeline to use software packaged using different methods (Docker, Singularity, Podman, Shifter, Charliecloud, Conda) - see below. When using Biocontainers, most of these software packaging methods pull Docker containers from quay.io e.g [FastQC](https://quay.io/repository/biocontainers/fastqc) except for Singularity which directly downloads Singularity images via https hosted by the [Galaxy project](https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/) and Conda which downloads and installs software locally from [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/).

> We highly recommend the use of Docker or Singularity containers for full pipeline reproducibility, however when this is not possible, Conda is also supported.

The pipeline also dynamically loads configurations from [https://github.com/nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs) when it runs, making multiple config profiles for various institutional clusters available at run time. For more information and to see if your system is available in these configs please see the [nf-core/configs documentation](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation).

Note that multiple profiles can be loaded, for example: `-profile test,docker` - the order of arguments is important!
They are loaded in sequence, so later profiles can overwrite earlier profiles.

If `-profile` is not specified, the pipeline will run locally and expect all software to be installed and available on the `PATH`. This is _not_ recommended.

- `docker`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Docker](https://docker.com/)
- `singularity`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/)
- `podman`
  - A generic configuration profile to be used with [Podman](https://podman.io/)
- `shifter`
